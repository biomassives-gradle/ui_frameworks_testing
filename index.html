<h1>Comparing the 'top choice' jine 1 2015 UI Frameworks
</h1>

<h2>Via Meteor</h2>

The following meteor packages allow us to quicly develop testable code for comparison
<pre>
useraccounts:bootstrap styled for Twitter Bootstrap
useraccounts:foundation styled for Zurb Foundation
useraccounts:ionic styled for Ionic
useraccounts:materialize styled for Materialize
useraccounts:polymer styled for Polymer (WIP)
useraccounts:ratchet styled for Ratchet
useraccounts:semantic-ui styled for Semantic UI
useraccounts:unstyled with plain html and no CSS rules
</pre>

The goal of this experiment is to provide simple a simple multi-parameter 
decision tree format that can easily be used for subsequent versions of the above
listed frameworks, while maintaining the ability to easily add a new framework or set of test results at will.


<h2>Testing from a docker container or vagrant box</h2>


this method simplifies our use of the frameworks in that all dependenies are managed for the system provided, and that
a local machines's existing software will not conflict with the testing setup.  Isolated containers! :)
